If you are here, it means that you want to use my tool OMI but you have a question on how to use it.  
I can't be availaible 7j/7.  
  
I suggest you to write down your question here: [Submit question](https://openmacroinput.page.link/submitquestion)  
You can contact me if you see that I seem available: [Discord](https://openmacroinput.page.link/discord)  

I will answer where I have time and will compile them in a "faq compilation video".

Hope you enjoy the software.
